Idea of project is to create new simple product which will help people, for example to count the visitors.
It takes amount of clicks and creates a graph based of data during the time. 

*It is flexible 
(if time exceed 60 seconds it shows 60 minutes, if > 60 minutes - hours, moreover it has automatic adjustment for values)

*It has the lightest weigth because it doesn't use any libraries

*It is helpfull if you want to get the speed/amount of exercises your friend does/get customers history during the day!
